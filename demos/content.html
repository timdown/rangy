        <b>Association football</b> is a sport played between two teams. It is usually called <b>football</b>, but in
        some countries, such as the United States, it is called <b>soccer</b>. In
        <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Canada and
        Republic of Ireland, both words are commonly used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each team has <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">11 players</span> on the field. One of these players is the <i>goalkeeper</i>, and the other ten are
        known as <i>"outfield players."</i> The game is played by <b>kicking a ball into the opponent's goal</b>. A
        match has 90 minutes of play, with a break of 15 minutes in the middle. The break in the middle is called
        half-time.
    </p>
    <h2>Competitions</h2>
    <p>
        There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play
        other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. <b>Cardiff City F.C.</b> from Wales for example, play
        in the English leagues and in the English FA Cup.
    </p>
    <h2>Who plays football</h2>

countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation
Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the
United Nations.
