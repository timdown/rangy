Rangy
=====

A cross-browser JavaScript range and selection library.

The current development version is version 1.3. It's officially still in alpha but the core and most modules are pretty stable. The new [TextRange](../../wiki/Text-Range-Module) and [Highlighter](../../wiki/Highlighter-Module) modules are still in active development and as such are more unstable.

The latest source code and releases of version 1.3 are on [GitHub](../../releases). Downloads of stable 1.2 builds are on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/rangy/downloads).

## Bower

There is now an official Rangy 1.3 package for Bower, called `rangy-official`.

## AMD

Rangy now has AMD support.

## NPM

There is a Rangy module on NPM called [`rangy`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/rangy). It doesn't do anything useful in Node but you can do Browserify stuff with it.
