=====

A cross-browser JavaScript range and selection library.

The current development version is version 1.3. It's officially still in alpha but the core and most modules are pretty stable. The new [[TextRange|Text Range Module]] and [[Highlighter|Highlighter Module]] modules are still in active development and as such are more unstable.

The latest source code and releases of version 1.3 are on [GitHub](../releases). Downloads of stable 1.2 builds are on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/rangy/downloads).
